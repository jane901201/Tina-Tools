description: Research and implementation guidance for DirectX graphics programming. Use when tasks involve Direct3D 11 or Direct3D 12 APIs, command queues and lists, resource barriers, descriptor heaps, shader compilation, HLSL debugging, frame capture analysis, or GPU performance bottleneck investigation.

# DirectX Research

1. Confirm API version (D3D11 or D3D12), feature level, GPU and driver, and reproduction steps.
2. Prioritize Microsoft official documentation, SDK samples, and primary references.
3. Validate pipeline state, resource lifetime, synchronization, and barrier correctness first.
4. Provide a diagnostics plan with PIX or validation-layer evidence when possible.
5. Read references/topics.md for checklists and common failure patterns.
