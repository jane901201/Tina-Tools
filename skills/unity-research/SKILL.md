# Unity Research

1. Confirm Unity version, target platform, render pipeline, and reproduction steps.
2. Prioritize official Unity documentation and package docs as primary sources.
3. Build minimal reproducible samples before proposing broad refactors.
4. Propose fixes with clear tradeoffs, risks, and verification steps.
5. Read references/topics.md for reusable checklists and version-specific notes.
