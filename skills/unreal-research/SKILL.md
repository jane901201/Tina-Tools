# Unreal Research

1. Confirm Unreal version, target platform, build configuration, and reproduction steps.
2. Prioritize official Unreal documentation and Epic primary sources.
3. Reproduce issues in minimal levels or projects when possible.
4. Separate Blueprint-level fixes from C++ engine-level fixes explicitly.
5. Read references/topics.md for recurring patterns and engine-version caveats.
